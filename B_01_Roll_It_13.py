*** Instructions ***
    
To begin, decide on a winning score (eg: The first one to get a score of 50 points wins).

For each round of the game, you win points by rolling dice.
The winner of the round is the one who gets closest to 13 without going over.

If you win the round, then your score will increase by the number of points that you earned.
If your first roll of two dice is a double (eg: both dice show a three),
then your final score will be double the number of points.

If you lose the round, then you dont get any points.

If you and the computer tie ( eg: you both get a score of 11),
then you will both have 11 points added to your score.

Your goal is to reach the target goal before the computer.

Good Luck!
